# Docker Forma LMS (Based on Nicholas Wilde formalms container)

A docker container for the e-learning platform [Forma LMS](https://www.formalms.org/) based on the official php:7.0-apache image.

## Dependencies

In order to run this container you'll need: 

A compatible SQL database:

* MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB  10.3
* UTF8 character set
* MySQL strict mode disabled

## Usage

### docker cli

The web page runs on the default http port

```shell
docker run -p 8080:80 nicholaswilde/formalms
```
Then you can go to `http://localhost:8080/install` to complete the installation.

### Volume

The default UID and GID for the `app` volume is `www-data:www-data` or `33:33`

### docker-compose

See [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml).

This will install both Forma LMS and a MySQL database
You can use [the forma.cnf file in this repository](https://github.com/nicholaswilde/docker-formalms/blob/master/config/forma.cnf) to set both character set to utf8 and disable strict mode at creation time, otherwise you'll have to do it manually.

As with `docker run` got to the web page `http://localhost:8080/install` to complete the installation.

With this compose file you can just set `db` as the database host during installation and `formalms` as database name, user and password.
The database is not exposed outside of the stack, but you can always change the database parameters to be on the safer side.
